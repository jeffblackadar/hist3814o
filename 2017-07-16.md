Fail log for week 2 - Ending 16 July 2017.
## EXERCISE 1: learning markdown syntax with dillinger.io

Here is the markdown cheat sheet:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Failure: I was not in a good mood to write. Moving on but will return.

I cam back to this on Saturday morning pretty fired up after thinking about it.  Also talking about the issue I wanted to discuss (the decline in the number of women studying in Computer Science since 1984) with my wife and daughter gave me additional insight.  I am glad I procrastinated.

I made the post for the exercise in Dillinger.io, downloaded it and put it in Github. 
### Failures: ###
1. I see the footnotes in Markdown in [my post] don't render in the Gitbub .md editor. 
2. I asked Dillinger.io to export as a pdf.  It's hung.  I tried export as Markdown and also Styled HTML, that worked.  I will try again later.


## EXERCISE 2: Getting familiar with DHBox
### Get on Carleton University VPN

From my home computer I launched application Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client

I logged in with my CU ID

Now I am on Carleton U VPN

### Open DHBox
Go to http://134.117.26.132:5000

Click Log in. Use DHBox ID.

Once logged in, click on my name in the upper right of the screen, click Apps.

Went into Command Line.  Logged in with DHBox ID

## Exercise 3.

I created a repository in Gitbub. Then I was asked to do a "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before." Apparently I need to run some commands to set up necessary files like a readme.md. This is different than when I made my first repository. I am wondering if I am seeing this because I already made a repository and the first one gets set up with all of the necessary files (like readme.md) out of the box. I am not sure what to do, I expect I will learn about the commands Github expects me to run in exercise 4. I mention this because I can't really proceed to the next part of this exercise until I solve this.

Fail: I forgot to commit the solution to this problem I wrote as an annotation while at the coffee shop. Here it is below.

There was a message "We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore." Each of "README, LICENSE, and .gitignore." was linked. When I clicked on each link, Github opened an editor which allowed me to create and commit each of these files. This allowed me to use the repository without seeing the page indicating I needed to set these files up.

### Excercise 3, Git init, continued
Performed:

$ mkdir first-repo

Results: Success: $ ls 

dhbox-work-today.md  first-repo

Performed:

Create the readme file with the $ nano readme.md.  

Results: File created.  Watch out for typing CTRL+Z instead of CTRL+X, I lost a bit of work.

Performed: 

$ Git Init

Results: Initialized empty Git repository in /home/jeffblackadar/first-repo/.git/

:~/first-repo$ ls

readme.md

:~/first-repo$ cd .git

:~/first-repo/.git$ ls

branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs

:~/first-repo/.git$ 

I see there is a "hidden" folder called .git with what looks like are folders to contain version tracking for git

I did a cd \ and ended up at the root directory (I think).  I did a cd ~ and got back to where I needed to be.

Performed: 

$ git status

Result:

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:

(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

readme.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Performed: 

$ git commit -m "My first commit"

Result: (Fail)

:~/first-repo$ git commit -m "My first commit"

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.

Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: empty ident name (for <jeffblackadar@b7c243999794.(none)>) not allowed

Performed:

:~/first-repo$ git config --global user.email "jeffblackadar@gmail.com"

:~/first-repo$ git config --global user.name "Jeff Blackadar"

:~/first-repo$ git commit -m "My first commit"

Result: (Fail I think)

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:

readme.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

Here is why that failed.  I skipped $ git add -A. (Git switches as case sensitive.)

Performed:

:~/first-repo$ git add -A

:~/first-repo$ git status

Result:

On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:

(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

new file:   readme.md

Performed:

:~/first-repo$ git commit -m "My first commit"

Result:

[master (root-commit) 8054f79] My first commit

1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

create mode 100644 readme.md
 
Performed:

nano readme.md

Performed:

:~/first-repo$ git commit

Result:

On branch master

Changes not staged for commit:

modified:   readme.md

no changes added to commit

** Fail: ** Although I modified readme.md with nano, and git said the file was modified, it says it is not staged for commit.  So I did a $git add readme.md.  See below

:~/first-repo$ git status

On branch master

Changes not staged for commit:

(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)

(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified:   readme.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

:~/first-repo$ git add readme.md

:~/first-repo$ git status

On branch master

Changes to be committed:

(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

modified:   readme.md

Performed:

:~/first-repo$ git commit

Result:

### 4.6 Git Clone

Down tools for now

# Raspberry Pi - Using it for VPN and other course work.

## Github on Raspberry Pi
I started making notes in my fail log and did not read that Github does not support the version of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)

A user could see some things.

## Slack on Raspberry Pi
Slack does not support the version of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)

A user could see some things too.

## Hypothes.is on Raspberry Pi
Hypothesis does not work for annotations on versions of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)

I could see the annotations I had made after logging in.

## VPN Connect on Pi

### Open Connect
I followed these instructions

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get update

-result: Reading package lists... Done

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install openconnect vpnc-scripts -y

-result: Setting up openconnect (3.20-4) ...

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ opkg update

-result: fail. bash: opkg: command not found

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ opkg install openconnect vpnc-scripts

-result: fail. bash: opkg: command not found

--- I stopped here.

### Carleton AnyConnect VPN
I followed these instructions:

https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/remote-access/cisco-anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-for-linux/

At first I was using the Chromium Web Browser on the Pi - that failed.

I then used the Safari web browser on the Pi

I was able to log in

The AnyConnect software launched - but it downloaded the Windows version.

--- I stopped here.  I will ask for help. It is not time senstitive
