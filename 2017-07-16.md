Fail log for week 2 - Ending 16 July 2017.
## EXERCISE 1: learning markdown syntax with dillinger.io

Here is the markdown cheat sheet:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
Failure: I was not in a good mood to write. Moving on but will return.
I cam back to this on Saturday morning pretty fired up after thinking about it.  Also talking about the issue I wanted to discuss (the decline in the number of women studying in Computer Science since 1984) with my wife and daughter gave me additional insight.  I am glad I procrastinated.
I made the post for the exercise in Dillinger.io, downloaded it and put it in Github. 
### Failures: ###
1. I see the footnotes in Markdown in [my post] don't render in the Gitbub .md editor. 
2. I asked Dillinger.io to export as a pdf.  It's hung.  I tried export as Markdown and also Styled HTML, that worked.  I will try again later.


## EXERCISE 2: Getting familiar with DHBox
### Get on Carleton University VPN

Now I am on Carleton U VPN

### Open DHBox

## Exercise 3.

I created a repository in Gitbub. Then I was asked to do a "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before." Apparently I need to run some commands to set up necessary files like a readme.md. This is different than when I made my first repository. I am wondering if I am seeing this because I already made a repository and the first one gets set up with all of the necessary files (like readme.md) out of the box. I am not sure what to do, I expect I will learn about the commands Github expects me to run in exercise 4. I mention this because I can't really proceed to the next part of this exercise until I solve this.


# Raspberry Pi - Using it for VPN and other course work.

## Github on Raspberry Pi
I started making notes in my fail log and did not read that Github does not support the version of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)
A user could see some things.

## Slack on Raspberry Pi
Slack does not support the version of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)
A user could see some things too.

## Hypothes.is on Raspberry Pi
Hypothesis does not work for annotations on versions of Safari or Chromium that are on the Pi (updates were run)
I could see the annotations I had made after logging in.

## VPN Connect on Pi

### Open Connect
I followed these instructions

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get update
-result: Reading package lists... Done

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install openconnect vpnc-scripts -y
-result: Setting up openconnect (3.20-4) ...

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ opkg update
-result: fail. bash: opkg: command not found
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ opkg install openconnect vpnc-scripts
-result: fail. bash: opkg: command not found

--- I stopped here.

### Carleton AnyConnect VPN
I followed these instructions:
https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/remote-access/cisco-anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-for-linux/
At first I was using the Chromium Web Browser on the Pi - that failed.

I then used the Safari web browser on the Pi
I was able to log in
The AnyConnect software launched - but it downloaded the Windows version.

--- I stopped here.  I will ask for help. It is not time senstitive
