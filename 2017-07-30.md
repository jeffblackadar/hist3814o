# Module 3

## Some other discovery / research 

I thought if I could go through text, find proper nouns, look them up in Wikipedia for a hit, I could determine if they were (likely) significant.  Then I could mark them up as xml.

Below are some URLs from the reading I did...

      from nltk import pos_tag, ne_chunk
      from nltk.tokenize import SpaceTokenizer
      tokenizer = SpaceTokenizer()
      toks = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)
      pos = pos_tag(toks)
      chunked_nes = ne_chunk(pos)
      nes = [' '.join(map(lambda x: x[0], ne.leaves())) for ne in chunked_nes if isinstance(ne, nltk.tree.Tree)]

However, a much better way to do this exists: Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER)

I want to try to hook this up using python rather than java.

### Linux on Windows 10

Thanks to this post, I can run Linux on my Windows 10 PC.  grep and sed seem to work.  Exciting.  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide

### OCR On Linux on Windows

Installed tesseract

sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

#### Objective: Install and Run OCRFeeder

I wanted to have more control over what areas of a document were processed by OCR.  Command line tesseract did not provide this.  OCRFeeder has a GUI that uses Tesseract, so it looked like a good bet.

More about OCRFeeder:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCRFeeder

It looks like this:  https://github.com/jeffblackadar/hist3814o/blob/master/ocrfeeder.jpg

and can produce this:   https://github.com/jeffblackadar/hist3814o/blob/master/pag1_ocr.pdf

I installed OCRFeeder  https://github.com/GNOME/ocrfeeder/blob/master/README

I have to check, I think I did sudo apt-get install ocrfeeder   (Fail: I should have kept notes when I started this idea.)

I needed to install an image library for Python to make this work. The image library was Pillow. To install, I needed python-pip. so I installed that:

       $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

The I installed Pillow

       $ pip install Pillow

I then had to make changes to these files to make OCRFeeder with the image library

I made this change:

       # import Image
       from PIL import Image

in:

       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/util/lib.py
       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/util/graphics.py
       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/studio/dataHolder.py
       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/studio/widgetPresenter.py
       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/feeder/layoutAnalysis.py

I made these changes:

       # import Image
       from PIL import Image
       # import ImageDraw
       from PIL import Image
       
in: 

       $ sudo nano /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ocrfeeder/feeder/imageManipulation.py

#### Installed an X Server

On Windows, OCRFeeder would not launch its screen.  I needed to install an X Server.  (I'm not sure what exactly that is, but it worked.)

Then I got another copy of the Equity

sudo wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1959/09/10/83471_1959-09-10.pdf --no-parent

## Exercise 1

Registered for a dhbox on dhbox.org 

** Thank you DHBox.org! It is very kind of you to be open to students like me **

Performed

           $ curl http://archive.org/stream/diplomaticcorre33statgoog/diplomaticcorre33statgoog_djvu.txt > texas.txt
           
I reviewed the contents of text.txt

1. Shout out to ascii art!:

          <!-- __ _ _ _ __| |_ (_)__ _____
              / _` | '_/ _| ' \| |\ V / -_)
              \__,_|_| \__|_||_|_| \_/\___| -->
              
2. More to the point I see content like:
  
          David G. Burnet to Richard G. Dunlap, August 19, 1839 54

Edited texas.txt.  Used CTRL+SHIFT+^ to mark text to delete, paged down and deleted it with CTRL+K.  Saved file as texas2.txt

Performed:  $grep '\bto\b' texas.txt

Results: (last 2 lines)

Wm. Henry Daingerfield to R. Sieveking, October 1, 1845 1582 
Wm. Henry Daingerfield to Ebenezer Allen, February 2, 1846 1582 

Made a back up of my own raw file:

$ cp texas2.txt texasbak.txt

I want to operate on texas3.txt

$ cp texas2.txt texas3.txt

I tried this:

$ sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+\bto\b.+)/~(.+\bto\b.+)/g' texas3.txt

Fail, and got this:

~(.+btob.+)

RESET:

$ cp texas2.txt texas3.txt

$ sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+\bto\b.+)/~\1/g' texas3.txt

Got the expected result:

      ~Anson Jones to Charles H. Raymond, October 24, 1844 316

      ~Charles H. Raymond to Anson Jones, November 27, 1844 317

and I have the backup sed made too:

texas2.txt  texas3.txt  **texas3.txt.bak**  texasbak.txt  texas.txt

Made a copy to work on the next step, texas4.txt

$ cp texas3.txt texas4.txt

$ grep '~' texas4.txt > index.txt

$ nano index.txt

I got the expected result, only the lines with a tilde were piped to index.txt

      ~Samuel A. Roberta to Joseph Eve, August 11, 1841 94
      ~Samuel A. Roberta to Joseph Eve, August 17, 1841 94
      ~Samuel A. Roberts to Barnard E. Bee, September 7, 1841 96
      ~Sam Houston to Joseph Eve, July 30, 1842 100
      ~Sam Houston to A. B. Roman, September 12, 1842 101
      
Make another copy

$ cp index.txt index2.txt

$ grep '[0-9]{4}' index2.txt

Nothing

This one did not return results for me:  grep '[0-9]{4}' index.txt    This one did:  grep '[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]' index.txt

However, sed worked.

$ sed -r -i.bak 's/(,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)/\2/g' index3.txt

Result:  ~Sam Houston to A. B. Roman, September 12 1842

### Step 4

Performed

$ sed -r -i.bak 's/(~)(.+)/\2/g' index4.txt

Result:  Sam Houston to A. B. Roman, September 12 1842  (~ is gone)

### Step 5

sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+)( to\b)(.+)/\1,\3/g' index5.txt

Result: Sam Houston, A. B. Roman, September 12 1842

I had some problems with this grep  .+,.+,.+

78  nano index5.txt
   79  grep '.+,.+,.+' index5.txt
   80  grep '.+,' index5.txt
   81  grep ',' index5.txt

  100  grep '.\+\(\,\)' index5.txt
  101  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+' index5.txt
  102  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+\(\,\)' index5.txt
  103  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+\(\,\).\+\' index5.txt
  104  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+\(\,\).\+' index5.txt
  105  nano index5.txt
  106  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+\(\,\).\+' index5.txt
  107  nano index5.txt
  108  grep '.\+\(\,\).\+\(\,\).\+' index5.txt
