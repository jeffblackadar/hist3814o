# Module 2
## Exercise 1

## Exercise 2
Learning to use wget.

I thought about using my home machine to hold the files for the Shawville Equity so that I don't clog DHBox and also so that I don't have to move things in the middle of the project.  For now I will use DHBox so that I do what the rest of the class is doing.

### wget

Example:

wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/

I tried --random-wait - I got an error.

:~/Spoon-Knife/wget-practice$ wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --random-wait --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/

idn_encode failed (1): ‘String preparation failed’

idn_encode failed (1): ‘String preparation failed’

--2017-07-18 01:44:15--  http://%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%93%C3%A2--random-wait/

Resolving â\302\200\302\223â--random-wait (â\302\200\302\223â--random-wait)... failed: Name or service not known.

wget: unable to resolve host address ‘â\302\200\302\223â--random-wait’

#### Wget of the Shawville Equity

Started with 1 year

wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --limit-rate=20k http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1883/

** fail ** I saw I was downloading pdfs.  Not needed.

I should be using a command like this

wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1883/ -A **.txt** -r --no-parent -nd –w 2 --limit-rate=20k

### Examining downloaded files.

#### I encountered directory collections.banq.qc.ca:8008

it's too long to type all the time, tried to rename it

:~/final-project/equity/src$ rename collections.banq.qc.ca:8008 collections

syntax error at (eval 1) line 1, near "ca:"

:~/final-project/equity/src$ rename "collections.banq.qc.ca:8008" collections

syntax error at (eval 1) line 1, near "ca:"

This failed, but I was able to rename it in the file 

#### It appears I downloaded everything except .txt

:~/final-project/equity/src$ ls

collections

:~/final-project/equity/src$ cd collections

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections$ dir

jrn03

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections$ cd jrn03

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03$ dir

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src$ cd 1883

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src/1883$ dir

06  07  08  09  10  11  12  index.html

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src/1883$ cd 06

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src/1883/06$ dir

07  14  21  28  index.html

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src/1883/06$ cd 07

:~/final-project/equity/src/collections/jrn03/equity/src/1883/06/07$ dir

83471_1883-06-07.pdf  index.html

Performed

wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1883/ -A .txt -r --no-parent -nd –w 2 --limit-rate=20k

Results are now what I expect.

:~/final-project/equity$ dir

83471_1883-06-07.txt  83471_1883-07-05.txt  83471_1883-08-02.txt (....etc.)

## Close Reading with TEI

What makes you believe this site is a trustworthy provider of historical texts?

Registered charity with a number.  Is a .org web site.  Has a street address.

What makes you believe this site is NOT a trustworthy provider of historical texts?

The look of the site is somewhat dated.  There are not many names of actual people who work on the website.  It's not part of a larger institution

Opened 'blanktemplate.txt' in Netbeans (for the notepad function)

renamed file to page19.xml

Transcribed a half a page of text manually, separating each paragraph with </p> (to close the paragraph) and <p> to open a new para.

I made an .jpeg of each column of text, save that file, and uploaded it to freeocr.com.

I ran one image through freeocr.com and got some text and some unreadble characters. However, it was faster to use some of the good text than to type it.

I converted the second image to just a black and white image and this reduced some of the background smudging that stopped good character recognition.  I OCR'd that and the results, albiet for a different column of text, seemed better.

### Failures

I opened up page19.xml in Chrome, I didn't see anything per a security warning that I can't open files from my PC that reference other files (see note about .xsl below) in Chrome.  This was in the instructions, I should have read more carefully.

I opened page19.xml in Microsoft Edge and it looked like a unformed text.

I had to correct two things

In the reference tag for place names, there was an ampersand &amp; in the URL.  I had to replace the &amp; with &amp;amp;

so that ...Virginia&amp;params...  became   ...Virginia**&amp;amp;**params...

I also have to look at line 2 of the xml file that references an .xsl file (the style)  I changed the name of the .xsl to page19style.xsl and then matched that file name in the declaration of where the style sheet is in the xml file (see line below)

<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="page19style.xsl"?>

After that it I could see style rendering and the tags working.

I will return to do more when there is time.

## Exercise 4

Performed:

http://search.canadiana.ca/search?q=%22New+Germany%22&field=&so=score&df=1800&dt=1900**&fmt=json**

Got back JSON data!  - This is wow.

         "creator" : [
            "DesBrisay, Mather B. (Mather Byles), 1828-1896"
         ],
         "note" : [
            "3 microfiches (141 fr.).",
            "\"Follow me back through a hoary century.\"",
            "Includes index.",
            "264 p."
         ],
         "title" : [
            "History of the County of Lunenburg",
