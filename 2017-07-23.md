## Exercise 1

## Exercise 2
Learning to use wget.

I thought about using my home machine to hold the files for the Shawville Equity so that I don't clog DHBox and also so that I don't have to move things in the middle of the project.  For now I will use DHBox so that I do what the rest of the class is doing.

### wget

Example:

wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/

I tried --random-wait - I got an error.

:~/Spoon-Knife/wget-practice$ wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --random-wait --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/

idn_encode failed (1): ‘String preparation failed’

#### Wget of the Shawville Equity

Started with 1 year

wget -r --no-parent -w 5 --limit-rate=20k http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1883/

** fail ** I saw I was downloading pdfs.  Not needed.
