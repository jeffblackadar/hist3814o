# Copy project from CU Portfolio to my instance of Mahara on jeffblackdar.ca

In CU Portfolio in the Portfolio menu, performed an export (leap 2 format, 2 different pages).  

In my Mahara, performed an import.  I got an error message "missing leap xml file)

Reperformed an export (leap 2 format, 1 page only).  

In my Mahara, performed an import.  This time it worked.

The imported page is here: http://jeffblackadar.ca/portal/view/view.php?id=12

# Running NLP with R.

Per

https://rpubs.com/lmullen/nlp-chapter

I did: 

     install.packages(c("NLP", "openNLP", "RWeka", "qdap"))
     install.packages("openNLPmodels.en",
                 repos = "http://datacube.wu.ac.at/",
                 type = "source")

This did not work:

sents(bio_doc) %>% head(2)

got: Error in sents(bio_doc) %>% head(2) : could not find function "%>%"
