# Fail log for final project

## Content Management

### Installed Mahara on jeffblackdar.ca

latest version with automatic updates installation (per best practice)

Rationale: It is a platform flexible enough to present information and one I have used before.

#### Equity raw files

Could not upload corpus of text files of Equity to Voyant, it took too long. The file was too large for Github.  I created a folder on jeffblackadar.ca in public_html called hist3814o_final to hold this.  I plan to point Voyant to this file.
