# Fail log for final project

## Content Management

### Installed Mahara on jeffblackdar.ca

latest version with automatic updates installation (per best practice)

Rationale: It is a platform flexible enough to present information and one I have used before.

#### Equity raw files

Could not upload corpus of text files of Equity to Voyant, it took too long. The file was too large for Github.  I created a folder on jeffblackadar.ca in public_html called hist3814o_final to hold this.  I plan to point Voyant to this file.

# Finding aid for the Equity

Searching through the Equity for content relating to various annual events meant clicking and a little guesswork to determine when, for example, the first edition was published after an Agricultural Fair that was held the 3rd weekend each September.  My eyes and wrist were sore.  I thought a finding aid with a list of editions and any significant events might be easier to handle.

So I downloaded just the titles of the Equity using the wget spider command

wget --spider --force-html -r -w1 -np http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/

Performed

ls -R 

I piped this into a file and used grep to get just a list of partial URLs, example:

http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1990/05/02/

This is not finished.
