# This is a log of activities, thoughts and failures during the first week of HIST3814o - M1

## Activities
### Hypothes.is
Installed the Hypothes.is plug-in for Chrome and made annotations.  
Class annotations are visible at:

#### Random thought: 
What about a geofenced historical annotation tool for places.  Maybe it exists?  As a person walks around and their device that is aware of location alerts them to (for example) "This is an ancient Mi'kmaq canoe portage route.", or "This is the site of Ottawa's city hall until it burned down in 1931.", etc.  It would make exploring a large battlefield like Gettysburgh more in depth?  Each entry would be appropriately referenced.

### Reclaim Hosting
I have set up a Wordpress blog at Reclaim hosting:

Here is where to log in to configure my domain and web site:

### Github
Github has been set up and I have created a repository for a fail log.

#### Github desktop
I installed GitHub desktop 64 bit.  
I cloned my on-line repository.  That is not complete yet.
Follow up: I didn't use the correct name.  I have now cloned the repository to my local machine.  I will save these edits and then move to editing on the local machine and then push up the edits to the GitHub web site.

I completed my local edits and could see changes marked in blue rows.  Nice.
I clicked Respository | Push and the changes were pushed to the website and now visible here.

### Slack
I have logged into Slack for the first time.

## Lessons learned or to be learned:
### Passwords and taking notes

*Why haven`t I learned this before?*
(I have copied this from an earlier entry in my blog before I realized I should have set up a fail log in Github.)
The conclusion I made from below: _Keep passwords safe by making them strong and don't write them down, but write down a clue to remember them._

>I am trying to log on and do a bit of work while at an airport, but I forget some of my passwords. My current passwords are strong and different, but I did not keep note of a mnemonic for them. This reminds me of some bad habits I have had for a long time. Often when I start computer related projects I am excited and dive right in. If I take any notes at all, they are cryptic. Poor note taking may be ok when I am working on something intensely, but when I`m interrupted it`s difficult to get started again. Sometimes these projects end up abandoned. So, one of the things I hope to learn from this course is to be more disciplined with my notes related to computer projects in the same way I am much better at writing down detailed references when I am working on a paper. Taking good notes saves time. You likely already know this, I am still learning that.

### Markdown
The more pound signs, the smaller the header.  Makes sense now that I think of it: ### = H3, etc.

### Github
Despite having some experience with source code version control tools (Team Foundation Server, Source Safe), I don't really know how Github works. I've downloaded stuff from it, but I don't full get Github yet. I expect that will come soon. 
Follow-up: I am getting a better idea now that I have used GitHub desktop.  Much more to learn.
