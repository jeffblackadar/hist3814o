# This is a log of activities, thoughts and failures during the first week of HIST3814o - M1

## Lessons learned or to be learned:
### Passwords and taking notes

*Why haven`t I learned this before?*
(I have copied this from an earlier entry in my blog before I realized I should have set up a fail log in Github.)
The conclusion I made from below: _Keep passwords safe by making them strong and don't write them down, but write down a clue to remember them._

>I am trying to log on and do a bit of work while at an airport, but I forget some of my passwords. My current passwords are strong and different, but I did not keep note of a mnemonic for them. This reminds me of some bad habits I have had for a long time. Often when I start computer related projects I am excited and dive right in. If I take any notes at all, they are cryptic. Poor note taking may be ok when I am working on something intensely, but when I`m interrupted it`s difficult to get started again. Sometimes these projects end up abandoned. So, one of the things I hope to learn from this course is to be more disciplined with my notes related to computer projects in the same way I am much better at writing down detailed references when I am working on a paper. Taking good notes saves time. You likely already know this, I am still learning that.

### Markdown
The more pound signs, the smaller the header.  Makes sense now that I think of it: ### = H3, etc.

### Github
Despite having some experience with source code version control tools (Team Foundation Server, Source Safe), I don't really know how Github works. I've downloaded stuff from it, but I don't full get Github yet. I expect that will come soon.
