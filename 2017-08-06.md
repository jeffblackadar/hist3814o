## Module 4 Exercise 3

Performed: 

        setwd("C:\\a_orgs\\carleton\\hist3814\\module4")
        # give yourself as much memory as you've got
        options(java.parameters = "-Xmx5120m")
        install.packages('rJava')
        library(rJava)
        ## from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mallet/mallet.pdf
        install.packages('mallet')
        library(mallet)
        
Result:

        > library(mallet)
        Error in library(mallet) : there is no package called ‘mallet’
        
So I ran with Library commented out

        setwd("C:\\a_orgs\\carleton\\hist3814\\module4")
        # give yourself as much memory as you've got
        options(java.parameters = "-Xmx5120m")
        install.packages('rJava')
        library(rJava)
        ## from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mallet/mallet.pdf
        install.packages('mallet')
        # library(mallet)
        
And then, (Commenting out installtions) because installations were done

        setwd("C:\\a_orgs\\carleton\\hist3814\\module4")
        # give yourself as much memory as you've got
        options(java.parameters = "-Xmx5120m")
        #install.packages('rJava')
        library(rJava)
        ## from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mallet/mallet.pdf
        #install.packages('mallet')
        library(mallet)
        
Performed install.packages('RCurl'), and added lines to get data, count it and plot it.

        setwd("C:\\a_orgs\\carleton\\hist3814\\module4")
        # give yourself as much memory as you've got
        options(java.parameters = "-Xmx5120m")
        #install.packages('rJava')
        library('rJava')
        ## from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mallet/mallet.pdf
        #install.packages('mallet')
        library('mallet')
        #install.packages('RCurl')
        library('RCurl')
        x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/exercise/gh-pages/CND.csv", .opts = list(ssl.verifypeer = FALSE))
